My master project has been developed around the magic lantern, the first slide projector, and handmade animations. 
Concerning the subject, a recent trip to Japan and my passion for this country led me to create a first short animation, more like a travel journal: "Recollection from Japan."
Then a second one "Hanmenkyoshi" illustrates the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe.
