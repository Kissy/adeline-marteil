Entry to the D&AD Competition 2012 about the organization Peace One Day. Brief sponsored by Interbrand.

Don’t let Peace Day be ignored.

“Over the last 10 years, Peace Day has been proved as an opportunity for life-saving activities and action by individuals worldwide. 
For Peace Day 21 September 2012, Peace One Day is calling for and working towards a day of ceasefire and non-violence - the Global Truce 2012 campaign. 
We hope that this will be the largest reduction in global violence in recorded history, both domestically and internationally – and the largest ever gathering 
of individuals in the name of peace.”

Concept declinable in print (posters, flyers), media (web) and textile support.
