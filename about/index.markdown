Adeline Marteil is 23-years-old graphic designer. She originally comes from France, where she did her undergraduate degree in graphic design at ESAD (Orléans). Currently a Master student at UWE, in Bristol, she uses this opportunity to develop her practice through a variety of projects.

Her interest in graphic arts is not new and it has always been an important part of her life. Very curious and keen to explore, she takes her inspiration in the numerous trips she did (it could be safe to say that she practically covered every continent), but also in her everyday life, exploring issues and meeting people.

Indeed, Adeline does not see graphic design as an end in itself, but rather as a mean to help and improve people’s lives, as well as serve the society.

Particularly interested in the use of different mediums, she likes to mix photography, drawing, collage and typography in her work. Recently, she has also started experimenting with projection through the magic lantern, in order to take her practice further.
